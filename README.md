Here are more details about the main features of your KeshavSoft website:

### Clean and Modern Design

The website uses a clean layout with modern fonts and smooth color gradients, making information easy to read and visually appealing. The design also adapts for different screen sizes (responsive), so it looks good on both computers and mobile devices.[1][2]

### Responsive Navigation Bar

The navigation bar at the top allows users to quickly move between the Home, About, and Contact pages. It automatically collapses into a menu on small screens, making it easy for mobile users.[1]

### Features Section

There is a dedicated section for listing company features, such as:
- Innovative web and mobile development
- Data-driven digital marketing solutions
- Dedicated support and continuous improvement[3]
This helps visitors quickly learn what the company offers.

### Pricing Plans

Users can view simple pricing cards for Free, Pro, and Enterprise plans, each showing what is included (number of users, storage, type of support). This helps customers choose the service that best fits their needs.[1]

### Contact Form

The Contact page provides an easy-to-use form where visitors can enter their name, email, and message to reach out to KeshavSoft directly. This is linked from the homepage for convenience.[4]

### Visual Styling

The CSS file applies bright gradients, professional fonts, and spacing that improve the overall appearance and readability of the site.[2]

These features work together to make the website professional, functional, and user-friendly for anyone who visits.
